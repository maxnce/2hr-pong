# 2 hour pong

This is the result of a 2-hours challenge I gave to myself after i followed a 2-hours course in CPP. Even though I already did CSFML, I did not know some flags to compile SFML so it made me waste precious time.

Obviously, this code is not the best, since then I have learned much more about the language.

To try, make sure sfml is installed, then run `make` and `./pong`.

Controls are for [racket up : racket down]:

- Player1 [a : q]
- Player2 [Up arrow : Down arrow]
